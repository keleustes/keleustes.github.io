CRD have been created and added to the underlying Kubernetes Cluster. Note that using CRDs does not force the Airship architecture to migrate to operator architecture immediatly. Some efforts has been spent into getting the OpenAPIV3Schema in the deploy/crds/xxx.yaml to be as accurate as possible. This helps getting kubectl version syntax verification. Still the real syntax check will be performed into helmv3 since it verifies the syntax of the values obtained from layering the \u0026ldquo;override\u0026rdquo; values on top of the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; values provided in the chart.

Thanks to the work done by the the metal3.io team, most of that this POC has become irrelevant. The remaining questions that can be kind of answered by this POC are:  Is DivingBell still relevant. Is the cluster-api in charge of updating, rebooting machines when the machine specs are updated. How much of Promenade is still relevant. cluster-api indeed helping to save the kubeadm token into configmaps to help machine to join. Can kustomize be used to build the cluster-api MachineList and Cluster CRDs.   Documentation  TBD  Associated GIT Repos  cluster-api cluster-api-provider-baremetal cluster-api-provider-airship  \n"
