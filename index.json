For that purpose improvments have been made and proposed to the kustomize community.\nCRD have been created and added to the underlying Kubernetes Cluster. Note that using CRDs does not force the Airship architecture to migrate to operator architecture immediatly.\nSome efforts has been spent into getting the OpenAPIV3Schema in the deploy/crds/xxx.yaml to be as accurate as possible. This helps getting kubectl version syntax verification. Still the real syntax check will be performed into helmv3 since it verifies the syntax of the values obtained from layering the \u0026ldquo;override\u0026rdquo; values on top of the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; values provided in the chart.\nDocumentation  ReadTheDocs Readme  Associated GIT Repos  kustomize airship-deckhand  \n"
