      <description>Deployment Flows CRDs in Deckhand In the Airship used for production deployment, the SiteManifest could be viewed as a composition of Custom Resources:
 &amp;ldquo;Drydock&amp;rdquo; CR describing the kubernetes nodes, network, kublet. &amp;ldquo;ArmadaChart&amp;rdquo; CR describing the location of the helm chart and the helm chart value override.  Shipyard, Drydock and Armada are orchestrating the order of deployment:
 BareMetal OS, Network Docker, Kubelet, Kubernetes Storage, CEPH Applications for instance MariaDB  In the subsequent drawings, red arrows represent APIs and CLI calls (arship or kubernetes calls), blue arrows represents events generated by K8s.</description>

      <description>Greenfield Deployment Schema Rationale  Ops Team need to deploy a new service. If the service is unhealty, it gets removed. If the service is healty, it reaches the operational.  Brownfield Change Schema Rationale  Ops Team need to:
 Use Case 1: remove a service. Use Case 2: update a service. Use Case 3: rollback a service.  Once the traffic is drain:
 Use Case 1: the service is removed.</description>

      <description>Ideas  Can we use the &amp;ldquo;finalizer&amp;rdquo; to implement the &amp;ldquo;protected&amp;rdquo; feature of ArmadaChart. We need a consistent handling of Conditions, Events and Status and behavior which are easily understood by people understanding K8s. &amp;ldquo;kubectl get act&amp;rdquo; should be able to return a synthetic view as good as the &amp;ldquo;kubectl get pod&amp;rdquo; does. The Status object should be accurate enough for the DAG in the Argo Workflow to stay simple.</description>

      <description>Openstack Service Lifecycle Schema Rationale  Some transitions from one phase/stage to the other are autonomous:  Start to test if install successful) xxx  Some transitions from one phase/stage to the other but be triggered by Ops.  For instance, the traffic will not be drained from a site unless Ops needs to perform operations: xxx  Some of the lifecyle can be applied to one slice/shard of the a service.</description>
